miniBSD (ARM) 3.3.4 Hello there. I saw that Minix is abandoned, and I decided that it would be awful to let it just rot. It is not deserved, this ancient form of Unix gave birth to Linux - Linus' Unix. Minix Stands for Mini-Unix, so I've got the best name for a fork I could figure out - miniBSD - Microkernel Berkeley Software Distribution. Keep in mind that this is just a test, and something I personally really care about. There won't be any packages as of now, hopefully that'll soon change. You can contribute to this repository if you want to. I have no idea what I'm doing 

Toxic people aren't welcome.
I am currently working on a more concrete license.

Main Goals:
Remove amd64/i86 - CISC support in order to focus on simpler more embedded-friendly devices running on RISC x
Compile a Binary Package (I honestly have no idea how to accomplish this as I'm only used to JIT) x
Update to the latest version of NetBSD x
Add a WebKit enabled web-browser x
Remove obsolete drivers x
Clean up the tree in general x
Migrate to the Z Shell x (This is going to be wild)
Add improvements from FreeBSD and Apple's XNU x
Also stick everything atop a port of the ARM-MBED kernel x

I appreciate any support ❤

ToS are coming very soon!
